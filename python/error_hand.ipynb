    "We catch the ValueError exception locally within the function and handle it by printing an informative error message. Depending on the situation, we might also take additional actions, such as returning a default value or logging the error.\n",
    "By handling the exception locally within the function, we maintain context and can provide more specific error handling tailored to the operation being performed.\n",
    "Benefits of Handling Exceptions Locally:\n",
    "Better Context: By handling exceptions locally, you maintain context about where and why the exception occurred, making it easier to diagnose and debug errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Error Handling: Local exception handling allows you to provide specific error messages or take appropriate actions based on the operation being performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular and Maintainable Code: Handling exceptions locally within functions promotes modularity and maintainability by encapsulating error handling logic close to where it's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, handling exceptions locally ensures that errors are caught and handled in the appropriate context, making your code more robust, maintainable, and easier to debug."
